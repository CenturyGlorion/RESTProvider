Narrative:

In order to insert a XML into the database
As a response parser
it should parse and insert the XML into database correctly

Given the following XML:
---
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<result>
    <status>0</status>
    <statusMessage>status</statusMessage>
    <children>
        <child>one</child>
        <child>two</child>
    </children>
    <animals>
        <type>tiger</type>
        <type>rabbit</type>
        <type>squirrel</type>
    </animals>
    <name>A</name>
</result>
---
When I configure the root node to be "result"
And I configure a one to many relationship on node "children"
And the relationship "children" is configured with root node "children"
And I configure a one to many relationship on node "animals"
And the relationship "animals" is configured with root node "animals"
Then I should get a count of 1
And I should get a count for 1 child of 3
And I should get a count for 2 child of 2
