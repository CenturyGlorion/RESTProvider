Scenario: 
Given the following JSON: {"parent": "dady", "children": [{"id": 1, "value": "john"},{"id": 2, "value": "doe"}]}
When I have a JsonFactory
Then I should have a parent node with 1 children
The parent node should contain field "parent" with value "dady"
The child node from field "children" with index 0 should contain field [id, value] and value [1, john]
