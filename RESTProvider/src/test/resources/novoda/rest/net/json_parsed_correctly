Given the following json: {"root": {"id": 1, "value": "test"}}
And table name is "root"
When I parse against root node "root"
Then I should get a count of 1
And I should get columns: [id,value]
And I should get SQL insert "INSERT INTO root(id, value) VALUES(?,?);"
And the insert index of "id" should be 0
And the insert index of "value" should be 1
And the object returned for index 0 and field "id" should be 1
And the object returned for index 0 and field "value" should be test
